# CVE-2021-39273
## _In XeroSecurity Sn1per 9.0 (free version), insecure permissions (0777) are set upon application execution, allowing an unprivileged user to modify the application, modules, and configuration files. This leads to arbitrary code execution with root privileges._ 

# CVE-2021-39274
## _In XeroSecurity Sn1per 9.0 (free version), insecure directory permissions (0777) are set during installation, allowing an unprivileged user to modify the main application and the application configuration file. This results in arbitrary code execution with root privileges._

Although all files are owned by root, permissions on the containing directory allow us to manipulate the files, so a backdoor can be placed in one of the scripts. Another, probable more stealthy, modification would be to place the backdoor in the config file (`sniper.conf`) as this file is sourced via bash `source` command.

As the application must be executed by root, ensured by an EUID check in the script:

```
if [[ $EUID -ne 0 ]]; then
   echo "This script must be run as root"
   exit 1
fi
```
placing backdoor in it will execute it with `root privileges` next time the application is used.

## Root cause

Lines 37-40 of the installation script:
```
mkdir -p $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
chmod 777 -Rf $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
chown root $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
chmod 4777 $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
```

## CVE-2021-39273

Upon first execution of the application as a scanner main script `sniper` executes function `init` that recursevly changes permissions on the installation directory and it's contents.

As with _CVE-2021-39274_ this allows modification of all application files including executables and configurations and placing backdoor in them that would be executed with `root privileges` next time application is used by `root`.
 
 ## Root cause
 
 Lines 464-466 of the the main script:
  ```
  chmod 777 -Rf $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
  chown root $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
  chmod 4777 $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
 ```
